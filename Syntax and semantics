For the Syntax and semantics their is a lot I can talk about, thefirst thing is how this language does not follow the norm of other progrmaing languages and starts arrays at 1 not 0
This took me some time to get strigh in my head as I would iterate one to many times on some of my loops.
Another thing that makes this outside the norm of languages I have used is that the use of semicolens are more for the programers convinces by suppresing the output box,
luckly I still have the habit of adding them so I was fine. One thing that I learned that was amazing to me and I wish opther languages used was %%, this allows for you to segment you code
into diffrent blocks. these blocks can run independely of eachother and allow for you to orginze you code a lot more. Another thing is that MatLab uses [] {} () brackets in very specific 
but diffrent ways to many other languages I have used, more importently that you can have a user definded functionj give off more then one output. That was crazy to wrap my head around
for reference to anyone reading this, I programmed in C and Java before this class so switching to an engeeneering based language has some major differences. The other thing thats interesting
with MatLab is that is bases everything off arrays, scalers, and vectors. I learned about cell arrays which were cool to play with, they allow for many diffent data types to be stored in one array.
