# Instructions for Using your Assignments Repository

**DISCAIMER:  I have never used github or github classroom as a teaching tool before, so I am learning along with you.  It is very hard to predict how these tools will work until we try stuff, so we might have to fine tune things as we progress.  For now, I think I have a plan.**

NOTE:  The main purpose of this repository template is to provide you with something to clone (so you don't have to initialize your local repository to push to the right location).  There isn't much else here...but this should be enough to clone.

To clone the repository and start adding your content to it locally, navigate to the folder you want to work in for your assignments and clone this repository.  You will then see a subfolder called Assignments-yourUserName.  You can do whatever you want in that, and then use a tool to _add_ what you do to what is being tracked, _commit_ what you do to the local reository, and then _push_ what you do back up to the remote repository.  I suggest you use a terminal to do this in command line (ex gitbash for Windows), but you may prefer some other GUI tool.

Follow these two basic steps to get started:

1.  Create a folder called assnX for each assigmnet in the course, and push your work to those folders as approriate.
    * You can add folders and files to your repository in any way you see fit (unless otherwise specified in an assignment's instructions), but keep things organized
    * If there are instructions in an assignment about how to organize something, follow them - this will help your TA and I mark.
    * Feel free to include more than what is required for the assignment in each folder, but keep things organized.
    
2.  Create your Journal Wiki based on the template described in the instructions and start making journal entries.
    * Don't forget to add a comment to (at least) the first wiki entry every week -  "Journal Entry Week X" 

**A Word of Caution:  git and github take some time to get used to.  Use your assignments as a way to figure out how to do all the basics.  Don't get frustrated when things mess up...that is bound to happen when you are just starting to figure things out.  And if we need to, we can resort to submitting your assigments in D2L, so you never need to panic if you can't figure something out.  This is more about learning git then it is about using the repo as an assignment bin.  BUT - this is a good opportunity to explore, so please take advantage.**
