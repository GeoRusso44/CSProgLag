With MatLab, their are a lot of Libraries that are availbe to the user, but unlike other languages where you need to import them MatLab seems to have them all included at the start,
but some functions are locked behind others. What I mean by this is in the assignment the function predict() would not be reconized by the help command untill I did help on fitcknn() becuase predict 
is a dependency on fitcknn. MatLab also has a lot of built in ways to work with data more effectivly then languages like Java or C, things like plots and subplots being fairly easy to
use. MatLab also has a lot more math functions then I ever delt with in Java or C. One thing that kept messing with me is the lack of camelCasing used in MatLab, alot of functions 
would just be two words slapped together. The use of cell arrays and the data being in the form of scalers and vectors made working with it interesting. I had to change how I was looking at the data
becasue im used to standered data types being int double char string[]. This made working with the data easier since I didnt have to worry as much about casting or dealing with unmatched data types.
